    To be honest, I am not sure yet what I want to get out of IS413 becasue I feel like it is still early in the semester.
    However, I would like to learn how to use more features and tools to help me build web applications.
    In addition, I think it would be very useful to have the ability to create web applications because I have also been
    interested in learning  how I might be able earn some income on my own and creating a web app might be an option.
    I just hope that I am able to have fun in this class and learn anything new and that anytime in the future, I will
    be able to use the skills I learn in this class.
